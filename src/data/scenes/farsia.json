Farj'a Nabaa al-Ghazzal is a Bedouin community, where a group of Palestinian families settled around 20 people, all belonging to the Harashina family. According to Ahmed, they have lived in this location for 47 years - they settled in this area because it was a good place for agricultural lands and find better pastures, sometimes as a consequence of forced displacement by Israeli settlers and the army. Most of these communities in the occupied West Bank also face an extremely difficult reality and are under the standing."
